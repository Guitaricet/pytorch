def vjp(func: Callable, *primals, has_aux: bool = False):
    """
    Standing for the vector-Jacobian product, returns a tuple containing the
    results of :attr:`func` applied to :attr:`primals` and a function that, when
    given ``cotangents``, computes the reverse-mode Jacobian of :attr:`func` with
    respect to :attr:`primals` times ``cotangents``.

    Args:
        func (Callable): A Python function that takes one or more arguments. Must
            return one or more Tensors.
        primals (Tensors): Positional arguments to :attr:`func` that must all be
            Tensors. The returned function will also be computing the
            derivative with respect to these arguments
        has_aux (bool): Flag indicating that :attr:`func` returns a
            ``(output, aux)`` tuple where the first element is the output of
            the function to be differentiated and the second element is
            other auxiliary objects that will not be differentiated.
            Default: False.

    Returns:
        Returns a ``(output, vjp_fn)`` tuple containing the output of :attr:`func`
        applied to :attr:`primals` and a function that computes the vjp of
        :attr:`func` with respect to all :attr:`primals` using the cotangents passed
        to the returned function. If ``has_aux is True``, then instead returns a
        ``(output, vjp_fn, aux)`` tuple.
        The returned ``vjp_fn`` function will return a tuple of each VJP.

    When used in simple cases, :func:`vjp` behaves the same as :func:`grad`

        >>> x = torch.randn([5])
        >>> f = lambda x: x.sin().sum()
        >>> (_, vjpfunc) = torch.func.vjp(f, x)
        >>> grad = vjpfunc(torch.tensor(1.))[0]
        >>> assert torch.allclose(grad, torch.func.grad(f)(x))

    However, :func:`vjp` can support functions with multiple outputs by
    passing in the cotangents for each of the outputs

        >>> x = torch.randn([5])
        >>> f = lambda x: (x.sin(), x.cos())
        >>> (_, vjpfunc) = torch.func.vjp(f, x)
        >>> vjps = vjpfunc((torch.ones([5]), torch.ones([5])))
        >>> assert torch.allclose(vjps[0], x.cos() + -x.sin())

    :func:`vjp` can even support outputs being Python structs

        >>> x = torch.randn([5])
        >>> f = lambda x: {'first': x.sin(), 'second': x.cos()}
        >>> (_, vjpfunc) = torch.func.vjp(f, x)
        >>> cotangents = {'first': torch.ones([5]), 'second': torch.ones([5])}
        >>> vjps = vjpfunc(cotangents)
        >>> assert torch.allclose(vjps[0], x.cos() + -x.sin())

    The function returned by :func:`vjp` will compute the partials with
    respect to each of the :attr:`primals`

        >>> x, y = torch.randn([5, 4]), torch.randn([4, 5])
        >>> (_, vjpfunc) = torch.func.vjp(torch.matmul, x, y)
        >>> cotangents = torch.randn([5, 5])
        >>> vjps = vjpfunc(cotangents)
        >>> assert len(vjps) == 2
        >>> assert torch.allclose(vjps[0], torch.matmul(cotangents, y.transpose(0, 1)))
        >>> assert torch.allclose(vjps[1], torch.matmul(x.transpose(0, 1), cotangents))

    :attr:`primals` are the positional arguments for :attr:`f`. All kwargs use their
    default value

        >>> x = torch.randn([5])
        >>> def f(x, scale=4.):
        >>>   return x * scale
        >>>
        >>> (_, vjpfunc) = torch.func.vjp(f, x)
        >>> vjps = vjpfunc(torch.ones_like(x))
        >>> assert torch.allclose(vjps[0], torch.full(x.shape, 4.))

    .. note::
        Using PyTorch ``torch.no_grad`` together with ``vjp``.
        Case 1: Using ``torch.no_grad`` inside a function:

            >>> def f(x):

            >>>         c = x ** 2
            >>>     return x - c

        In this case, ``vjp(f)(x)`` will respect the inner ``torch.no_grad``.

            >>> with torch.no_grad():
            >>>     vjp(f)(x)

        In this case, ``vjp`` will respect the inner ``torch.no_grad``, but not the
        outer one. This is because ``vjp`` is a "function transform": its result
        should not depend on the result of a context manager outside of ``f``.

    as an auxiliary object:

        >>>
        >>> jacobian_f, f_x = jacrev(g, has_aux=True)(x)
        >>> assert torch.allclose(f_x, f(x))

    :func:`jacrev` can be composed with vmap to produce batched

    By default, :func:`jacrev` computes the Jacobian with respect to the first
    input. However, it can compute the Jacboian with respect to a different
    argument by using :attr:`argnums`:

        >>> expected = torch.diag(2 * y)
        >>> assert torch.allclose(jacobian, expected)

    Additionally, passing a tuple to :attr:`argnums` will compute the Jacobian
    with respect to multiple arguments

        >>> from torch.func import jacrev
        >>> def f(x, y):

        Function to compute gradients with respect to its inputs. By default, the output of
        the function is the gradient tensor(s) with respect to the first argument.
        If specified :attr:`has_aux` equals ``True``, tuple of gradients and output auxiliary objects
        is returned. If :attr:`argnums` is a tuple of integers, a tuple of output gradients with
        respect to each :attr:`argnums` value is returned.

    Example of using ``grad``:

        >>> from torch.func import grad
        >>> x = torch.randn([])
        >>> cos_x = grad(lambda x: torch.sin(x))(x)
        >>> assert torch.allclose(cos_x, x.cos())
        >>>
        >>> # Second-order gradients
        >>> neg_sin_x = grad(grad(lambda x: torch.sin(x)))(x)
        >>> assert torch.allclose(neg_sin_x, -x.sin())

    When composed with ``vmap``, ``grad`` can be used to compute per-sample-gradients:

        >>> from torch.func import grad
        >>> from torch.func import vmap
        >>> batch_size, feature_size = 3, 5
        >>>
        >>> def model(weights, feature_vec):
        >>>     # Very simple linear model with activation
        >>>     assert feature_vec.dim() == 1
        >>>     return feature_vec.dot(weights).relu()
        >>>
        >>> def compute_loss(weights, example, target):
        >>>     y = model(weights, example)
        >>>     return ((y - target) ** 2).mean()  # MSELoss
        >>>
        >>> weights = torch.randn(feature_size, requires_grad=True)
        >>> examples = torch.randn(batch_size, feature_size)
        >>> targets = torch.randn(batch_size)
        >>> inputs = (weights, examples, targets)
        >>> grad_weight_per_example = vmap(grad(compute_loss), in_dims=(None, 0, 0))(*inputs)

    Example of using ``grad`` with :attr:`has_aux` and :attr:`argnums`:

        >>> from torch.func import grad
        >>> def my_loss_func(y, y_pred):
        >>>    loss_per_sample = (0.5 * y_pred - y) ** 2
        >>>    loss = loss_per_sample.mean()
        >>>    return loss, (y_pred, loss_per_sample)
        >>>
        >>> fn = grad(my_loss_func, argnums=(0, 1), has_aux=True)
        >>> y_true = torch.rand(4)
        >>> y_preds = torch.rand(4, requires_grad=True)
        >>> out = fn(y_true, y_preds)
        >>> > output is ((grads w.r.t y_true, grads w.r.t y_preds), (y_pred, loss_per_sample))

    .. note::
        Using PyTorch ``torch.no_grad`` together with ``grad``.

        Case 1: Using ``torch.no_grad`` inside a function:

            >>> def f(x):
            >>>     with torch.no_grad():
            >>>         c = x ** 2
            >>>     return x - c

        In this case, ``grad(f)(x)`` will respect the inner ``torch.no_grad``.

        Case 2: Using ``grad`` inside ``torch.no_grad`` context manager:

            >>> with torch.no_grad():
            >>>     grad(f)(x)

        In this case, ``grad`` will respect the inner ``torch.no_grad``, but not the
        outer one. This is because ``grad`` is a "function transform": its result
        should not depend on the result of a context manager outside of ``f``.

def functionalize(func: Callable, *, remove: str = 'mutations') -> Callable:
    """
    functionalize is a transform that can be used to remove (intermediate)
    mutations and aliasing from a function, while preserving the function's
    semantics.

    ``functionalize(func)`` returns a new function with the same semantics
    as ``func``, but with all intermediate mutations removed.
    Every inplace operation performed on an intermediate tensor:
    ``intermediate.foo_()``
    gets replaced by its out-of-place equivalent:
    ``intermediate_updated = intermediate.foo()``.

    functionalize is useful for shipping a pytorch program off to
    backends or compilers that aren't able to easily represent
    mutations or aliasing operators.

    Args:
        func (Callable): A Python function that takes one or more arguments.
        remove (str): An optional string argument, that takes on either
            the value 'mutations' or 'mutations_and_views'.
            If 'mutations' is passed in then all mutating operators
            will be replaced with their non-mutating equivalents.
            If 'mutations_and_views' is passed in, then additionally, all aliasing
            operators will be replaced with their non-aliasing equivalents.
            Default: 'mutations'.

    Returns:
        Returns a new "functionalized" function. It takes the same inputs as
        :attr:`func`, and has the same behavior, but any mutations
        (and optionally aliasing) performed on intermeidate tensors
        in the function will be removed.

    functionalize will also remove mutations (and views) that were performed on function inputs.
    However to preserve semantics, functionalize will "fix up" the mutations after
    the transform has finished running, by detecting if any tensor inputs "should have"
    been mutated, and copying the new data back to the inputs if necessary.

    There are a few "failure modes" for functionalize that are worth calling out:
      (1) Like other torch.func transforms, `functionalize()` doesn't work with functions
          that directly use `.backward()`. The same is true for torch.autograd.grad.
          If you want to use autograd, you can compute gradients directly
          with `functionalize(grad(f))`.
      (2) Like other torch.func transforms, `functionalize()` doesn't work with global state.
          If you call `functionalize(f)` on a function that takes views / mutations of
          non-local state, functionalization will simply no-op and pass the view/mutation
          calls directly to the backend.
          One way to work around this is is to ensure that any non-local state creation
          is wrapped into a larger function, which you then call functionalize on.
      (3) `resize_()` has some limitations: functionalize will only work on programs
          that use resize_()` as long as the tensor being resized is not a view.
      (4) `as_strided()` has some limitations: functionalize will not work on
          `as_strided()` calls that result in tensors with overlapping memory.


    Finally, a helpful mental model for understanding functionalization is that
    most user pytorch programs are writting with the public torch API.
    When executed, torch operators are generally decomposed into
    our internal C++ "ATen" API.
    The logic for functionalization happens entirely at the level of ATen.
    Functionalization knows how to take every aliasing operator in ATen,
    and map it to its non-aliasing equivalent
    (e.g. ``tensor.view({-1})`` -> ``at::view_copy(tensor, {-1})``),
    and how to take every mutating operator in ATen,
    and map it to its non-mutating equivalent
    (e.g. ``tensor.add_(1)`` -> ``at::add(tensor, -1)``),
    while tracking aliases and mutations out-of-line to know when to fix things up.
    Information about which ATen operators are aliasing or mutating all comes from
    https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/aten/src/ATen/native/native_functions.yaml.
